            <p>I studied at Trinity College, Cambridge from October 2016 to July 2019.</p>
            <p>There, I completed the Natural Sciences Tripos, aiming towards biological modules. Details of these can be found further down on this page.</p>
            <p>I really enjoyed my time there; though the work was intense and deadlines were constantly looming, I persevered through and made some great friends along the way.</p>

        <p>I have gained experience of working in the lab, including how to follow many procedures, health and safety and coordinating with others.</p>
        <p>I attended computer labs, where I gained basic programming skills and learned how to display data effectively.</p>
        <p>I've produced several presentations, both alone and in groups, as well as a scientific poster.</p>
        <p>I honed my writing skills through essays and my final dissertation, titled "A Critique on Cognitive Enhancement".</p>
