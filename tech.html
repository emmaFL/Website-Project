            <p>The box to the left displays the programming languages I have experience in.</p>
            <p>I learned MATLAB and R for the mathematical biology module of my <a href="bio.html">degree</a>. In MATLAB we wrote basic programs to get comfortable with the logic of coding, and used more complex programs to aid our learning, for example one that displays a phase-plane diagram for a pair of differential equations. We used R for computing statistics and displaying data in charts.</p>
            <p>To further increase my programming experience, I took the Code Nation Develop: Coding course, where I learned Python, HTML and CSS. I used my knowledge of Python to create a text-based adventure game with my team, something I really enjoyed. The HTML and CSS I learned are being used on this website. So I hope it looks good!</p>
            <p class="makemecenter">
                I'm also interested in learning:
                <br>
                C++
                <br>
                JavaScript</p>

        <p>Much of my free time is spent gaming, especially with friends. I mainly play on PC, but also have a Nintendo Switch. Genres I love include RPGs, strategy and simulation. I also spend a lot of time searching for and trying out game mods, to keep things interesting or improve quality of life. It would be so cool to be able to write my own mods and gain experience with coding at the same time.</p>
        <p>Aside from gaming, I spend a lot of time watching Youtube and listening to music with Spotify.</p>

    <div class="para1">
        <p>I would like to continue honing my skills at Python, R, HTML and CSS, as well as learn new languages like C++ and JavaScript. With these skills I want to pursue a career in tech, whether it be in software dev, web dev or bioinformatics.</p>
        <p>I'd also like to look into coding bots for Discord, and learn how to make my own mods for the games I like. Mainly to see if I can do it, then I can start coming up with more intricate ideas.</p>

        <p>Overall I am happy with the outcome of this website. I believe it has its strengths, but there are still a few weaknesses. The strengths include that the backgrounds make it quite pretty to look at (though I may be biased because they are my own photos), there is a variety of content to read about, and it should be easy to use and navigate. The weaknesses include that the interface is pretty basic. While minimalism can be popular, I think this should be backed up by having interesting features such as animations when you hover over things. I wish I had more time so I could get the site looking exactly how I want it to, but I believe I have done well with the time I had.</p>
