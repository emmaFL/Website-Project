        <p>Above is a map, colour coded according to places I've been to, places I'm going next and places I'd love to go in the future. I love travelling because it not only lets me immerse myself in different cultures, but I get to appreciate the unique geography and landscapes of different regions around the world. In particular, I adore mountainous and snowy areas; they are awe-inspiring, and perfect for photography, hiking and winter sports.</p>
        <p>I'm just an amateur photographer, but I take photos to remind me of the places I've been and the things I've seen. They can never quite capture the scenes in all their glory, but it is enough to transport me back in time. The backgrounds throughout this site are pictures I've taken while in Iceland, on a trip with my friends from university.</p>
        <p>In the following sections, I've included a few photographs from several place I've been. I then share plans for my next adventure: a solo trip beginning in Denmark, with travel through Sweden and into Finland.</p>

        <p>This map shows a rough idea of the route I will take when I undertake my solo trip through 3 Nordic countries: Denmark, Sweden and Finland.</p>
        <p>I've been wanting to go to this region for a very long time to witness the forests, lakes, architecture and culture of the countries within. To facilitate my trip I'm  learning Swedish, and also some Danish and Finnish. While on my trip, I'll be taking into account how I would feel to live in each place, because it is one of my dreams to move abroad and become fluent at the local language.</p>
        <p>This will be my first long trip where I am alone for most of the journey. For previous trips I've either always been with other people, or travelled alone to meet up with friends at the destination. While I love travelling with friends, I am doing this to experience what it's like as a solo traveller. It will push me out of my comfort zone, as all the tasks to do with planning and follow-through are my responsibilities. I'll have no one to rely on but myself. I'm excited to experience the independence that comes with that.</p>
        <p>I also plan to meet a couple friends I have met while gaming online. One lives near Stockholm, Sweden, and the other in Tampere, Finland. We've been talking for several years now over the Internet, so it would be pretty cool to meet them in person and get a drink together.</p>
        <p>My plan was to do this trip during the summer of 2020, but it had to be postponed thanks to the pandemic. At this point, I don't know when it will happen, but someday I will make it happen because this is something I've wanted for a long time.</p>
